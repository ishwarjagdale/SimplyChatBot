## Syntax
```
bot.py
```

## Stages
**Stage #1 Hello! What’s your name**  
Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.

**Stage #2 What's my name**  
Introduce yourself to the bot.

**Stage #3 How old are you**  
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.

**Stage #4 Let’s count!**  
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage!

**Stage #5 The student and the teacher**  
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better.
